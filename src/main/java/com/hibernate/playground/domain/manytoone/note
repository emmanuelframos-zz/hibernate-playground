When using a @ManyToOne association, the underlying foreign key is controlled by the child-side,
no matter the association is unidirectional or bidirectional.

Actually, the best-performing JPA associations always rely on the child-side to
translate the JPA state to the foreign key column value.

This is one of the most important rules in JPA relationship mapping, and it will be
further emphasized for @OneToMany, @OneToOne and even @ManyToMany associations.
