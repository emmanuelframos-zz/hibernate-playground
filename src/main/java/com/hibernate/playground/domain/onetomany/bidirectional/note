In a bidirectional association, only one side can control the underlying table relationship.

For the bidirectional @OneToMany mapping, it is the child-side @ManyToOne association in charge of
keeping the foreign key column.

This is the reason why the bidirectional @OneToMany relationship must define the "mappedBy" attribute,
indicating that it only mirrors the @ManyToOne child-side mapping.
