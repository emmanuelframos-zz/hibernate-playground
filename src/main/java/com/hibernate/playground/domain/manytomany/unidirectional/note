The Order word is a reserved keyword, you have to escape it. See Order class: @Table(name="`order`").

There is not much need for navigating this assocation from the Item relationship side
(although we can still do it with a JPQL query).

For @ManyToMany associations, CascadeType.REMOVE does not make too much sense when both
sides represent independent entities. In this case, removing a Order entity should not trigger
a Item removal because the Item can be referenced by other orders as well.

For both unidirectional and bidirectional associations, it is better to avoid the
CascadeType.REMOVE mapping. Instead of CascadeType.ALL, the cascade attributes should
be declared explicitly (e.g. CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE).
